# 🌟 AI Internship Project - Iris Flower Classification

**Author**: Nimisha Kambham  
**Internship Duration**: April 2025  
**Repository**: [Nimisha-Kambham](https://github.com/nimmy0006/Nimisha-Kambham)  
**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Guided by**: ChatGPT (Buddy 😉)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is part of my AI internship program and focuses on building classification models using the **Iris flower dataset**. The goal is to accurately predict the species of iris flowers based on input features like sepal and petal dimensions.

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

- ✅ Decision Tree (Gini Index)
- ✅ Decision Tree (Entropy)
- ✅ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- ✅ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- ✅ Random Forest

---

## 📊 Performance

All models achieved **100% accuracy** on the test data.  
Predictions were also made for a custom sample:  
🌸 `[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2] → Setosa`

## 🧪 Tools Used

- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
